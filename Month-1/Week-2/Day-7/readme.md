# Day 7 – Weekly Recap

## Purpose
To consolidate Week 2 networking knowledge into a single structured view.

---

## Step 1: Revisiting Labs
- Re-analyzed OSI and TCP/IP diagrams.
- Repeated key Wireshark captures to ensure concepts stick.
- Solved additional subnetting problems for speed and accuracy.

---

## Step 2: Creating a 1-Page Mindmap
The mindmap connects:
1. **OSI Layers** (with examples of protocols and devices).
2. **TCP/IP Stack** (showing practical implementation).
3. **Key Tools**:
   - `ping`: ICMP (Layer 3)
   - `traceroute`: Path determination
   - `ipconfig`: Interface configuration
   - Wireshark: Visualization across all layers
4. **Packet Flow**:
   - Encapsulation (Application → Physical)
   - Decapsulation (Physical → Application)
