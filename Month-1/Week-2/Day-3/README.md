# ðŸ”„ Day 3 â€“ TCP/IP Model vs OSI Model + Packet Flow Diagrams

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ TCP/IP Model Overview

TCP/IP is the actual model used on the Internet. Itâ€™s more practical than OSI, consisting of only 4 layers.

| TCP/IP Layer     | OSI Equivalent                      | Examples               |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Application      | Application + Presentation + Session | HTTP, FTP, SMTP        |
| Transport        | Transport                            | TCP, UDP               |
| Internet         | Network                              | IP, ICMP               |
| Network Access   | Data Link + Physical                 | Ethernet, Wi-Fi        |

## ðŸ†š Key Differences â€“ OSI vs TCP/IP

- **OSI** is a 7-layer theoretical model, used for teaching.
- **TCP/IP** is the 4-layer protocol stack used in the real world.
- OSI separates presentation/session explicitly; TCP/IP merges them into Application.

## ðŸ”§ Practical Tasks

### âœ… Task 2: Comparison Table
Created a markdown-based comparison table between both models.

## ðŸ§¾ Summary Notes

- The TCP/IP model simplifies implementation.
- Understanding packet journey helps in analyzing latency, failures, and exploits.
