# 🌍 Day 5 – DNS, DHCP, NAT, VPN (Real-World Networking)

## 📚 What I Learned

### 🔹 DNS – Domain Name System
- Converts human-friendly domains into IP addresses.
- Tools used: `nslookup`, `dig`
- Hierarchy: Root > TLD > Authoritative > Resolver

### 🔹 DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
- Automatically assigns IPs, subnet mask, default gateway.
- Reduces manual config & human errors.

### 🔹 NAT – Network Address Translation
- Allows multiple private IPs to share a single public IP.
- Types: Static, Dynamic, PAT (Port Address Translation)

### 🔹 VPN – Virtual Private Network
- Creates encrypted tunnel between client and server.
- Used for privacy, security, and bypassing geo-blocks.

## 🔧 Practical Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: DNS Lookups
- Ran `nslookup` & `dig` on:
  - `openai.com`
  - `github.com`
  - `google.com`



### ✅ Task 2: VPN Setup and Test
- Installed VPN browser extension (ProtonVPN)
- Checked public IP before and after connection




## 🧾 Summary Notes

- DNS is the "phonebook" of the internet.
- DHCP is essential for automating IP setup.
- NAT is used in nearly every home router.
- VPNs are now essential for both privacy & security.
