Hack The Box: Modules Completed

## Modules

### 1. Linux Structure
- Basic overview of how the Linux OS is organized.
- Concept of common directories and their purposes (like `/etc`, `/bin`, `/home` etc.).

### 2. Linux Distributions
- Understanding that multiple flavours (distributions) of Linux exist — each with its own package manager and release model.
- Basic concept of differences between popular distribution types (source-based, binary-based).

### 3. Introduction to Shell
- What a shell is (command interpreter) and why it is used.
- Basic interaction with the shell: typing commands, simple input/output behavior.

## The Shell

### Prompt Description
- Structure of the shell prompt (user@host:path style prompts) and what information it shows.
- Basic cues from the prompt (current user, current directory).

### Getting Help
- Using `man` pages, `--help` flags, or built-in help mechanisms.
- Checking command usage and available options.

### System Information
- Commands for basic system info (like kernel/version/hostname/whoami).
- Idea of tools that show hardware/software summaries.

## Workflow

### Navigation
- Moving around the filesystem (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls` basic commands).
- Short idea of relative vs absolute paths.

### Working with Files and Directories
- Overview of basic commands to create/inspect/delete files and directories (`touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `ls`, `stat`).
- Basic notion of file permissions (read/write/execute).

### Editing Files

## Closing note
This README is kept concise — only covering the topics you completed as shown in the screenshot. If you’d like, I can make this into a downloadable markdown file or add short command examples under each heading (only the ones you have already covered).
