Regular Expressions Practice
ðŸ“Œ What I Learned Today

Today, I studied Regular Expressions (RegEx) â€” a powerful way to search, match, and manipulate text.
I explored:

How RegEx can act like a blueprint for searching patterns.

The role of metacharacters (e.g., [], {}, (), .*, |).

How grouping, quantifiers, and operators make searching more precise.

Using RegEx with the grep command in Linux.

ðŸ”‘ Why This Practice Is Important

Configuration Audits: Many system files (like /etc/ssh/sshd_config) contain important security settings. RegEx helps us quickly analyze them.

Data Validation: Useful for checking structured inputs like emails, IPs, or passwords.

Efficiency: Instead of searching line by line, RegEx finds patterns instantly.

Security & Hacking Skills: In penetration testing and log analysis, RegEx is essential to filter sensitive information.

ðŸ›  Practice Exercises (with /etc/ssh/sshd_config)
1) Show all lines that do not contain #
grep -v '#' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2) Find all lines starting with Permit
grep -E 'Permit[A-Za-z0-9_-]*' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

3) Find all lines ending with Authentication
grep -E '\w*Authentication' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

4) Show all lines containing the word Key
grep -E 'Key' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

5) Lines beginning with Password and containing yes
grep -E '^Password.*yes' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

6) Lines ending with yes
grep -E 'yes$' /etc/ssh/sshd_config

ðŸ“– Key Takeaways

^ â†’ Match start of line.

$ â†’ Match end of line.

.* â†’ Match anything in between.

| â†’ OR operator.

-v â†’ Invert match (exclude lines).

Practice on real config files helps understand both Linux administration and pattern matching.

ðŸ‘‰ This practice not only improved my RegEx skills but also gave me insight into analyzing real configuration files that directly affect system security.
