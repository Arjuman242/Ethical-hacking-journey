# Day 1 — Understanding the Basics: What Is a Computer?

## Summary
Today, I began my journey into the depths of cybersecurity by questioning one of the most overlooked things: the computer itself. I explored its inner workings to understand how it obeys instructions, how logic flows through it, and why understanding this is crucial for hackers.

## Key Learnings
- A computer is not "intelligent" — it's a machine that follows instructions blindly.
- The core flow is: Input → Logic → Output.
- This logic is where vulnerabilities live. Hackers change inputs or logic to manipulate the system.
- Everything a computer does can be broken down into binary (0s and 1s).
- I learned how billions of transistors represent information — music, images, passwords, everything.
- Explored the CPU, RAM, Control Unit, ALU, and Registers in depth.
- Understood how memory works and how instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed.

## Concepts Explored
- What is a computer?
- Why do computers only use binary?
- Why was the computer even created?
- CPU structure (ALU, CU, Registers)
- RAM and how it temporarily stores live session data (exploitable by hackers)
- Binary logic and system obedience

## Resources Used
- CS50x Week 0 (Harvard)
- CrashCourse Computer Science #1

## Why This Matters
If you don’t understand how a machine truly works, you won’t know how to break or defend it. Learning cybersecurity starts by mastering how systems think and respond at the fundamental level.

## Questions I Asked Myself
- Why does a computer use binary and not base-10?
- Why do computers only understand 0 or 1?
- What is the exact difference between logic and algorithm?
- Why does the heap exist if we still define the size with malloc(20)?
